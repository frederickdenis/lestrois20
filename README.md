# lestrois20
Les trois 20 is an application I worked on with a classmate. Its sole function is to help users working long hours looking at a screen to apply the 20-20-20 rule; every 20 minutes of work, look away from your screen at a distance of 20 feet for 20 seconds.

* it is still a work in progress, in the next few weeks we would like very much to complete it.
